# 001 Read a File

In the language of your choice, write code to read a file.

Download [this file](/assets/001-no-man-is-an-island.md) and place it in any directory of your choice. In the same directory, create a script/program in any language of your choice 
that reads this file and prints it out to the screen.

Do not bother about placing the file and the script in a different directory. Right now, all that matters is that you can read a file that's saved to disk and write its contents out.
