# 006 Convert Column to Row from a File

In the language of your choice, write code to read a file containing a single column of data and transform it into a single row.

**Task:**

- Create a script/program that:
  - Opens [006-column-to-row.txt](/assets/006-column-to-row.txt)
  - Reads the file line by line, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace.
  - Collects the values into a list or array.
  - Joins the values into a single string, separated by commas.
  - Writes the resulting string to a new file named `row.txt`.
