# 002 Write a File

In the language of your choice, write code to create a new file and write content to it.

Create a script/program that:
- Creates a new file named `output.txt` in the current directory.
- Writes the following lines to the file:
```txt
The quick brown ü¶ä
jumps over the lazy üê∂.
```
- Closes the file after writing.
- Optionally, reads the file and prints its contents to the screen to verify the write operation.

**Note:** If the file already exists, ensure that its contents are overwritten.

**Hint:** Be mindful of character encoding. Emojis are Unicode characters and may cause encoding issues if not handled properly.
Ensure your program writes the file using UTF-8 encoding to support these characters.
