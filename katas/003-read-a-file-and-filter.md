# 003 Read a File and Filter

In the language of your choice, write code to read a file and filter its contents based on a specific condition.

**Task:**

- Create a script/program that:
  - Opens [003-filter.txt](/assets/003-filter.txt]
  - Reads the file line by line.
  - Filters and collects only those lines that contain the word `fox` (case-insensitive).
  - Prints the filtered lines to the screen.
  - Ensure that your program handles the file using UTF-8 encoding to support Unicode characters.


**Note:**

- Be mindful of character encoding. Ensure your program reads the file using UTF-8 encoding to support all characters.
