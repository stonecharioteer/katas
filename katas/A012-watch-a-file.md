# 012 Watch a File

In the language of your choice, write code that monitors a JSON file and prints its contents whenever the file is modified.

**Task:**

- Create a script/program that:
  - Monitors the output of [the previous exercise](/katas/11-update-json.md], [011-data.json](/assets/011-data.json) for changes.
  - Checks the file every second.
  - If the file has been modified since the last check, reads and prints its contents.

**Additional Requirements:**

- The program should run indefinitely until manually stopped.

**Note:**

- This exercise is useful for understanding file monitoring and detecting changes in file content.
