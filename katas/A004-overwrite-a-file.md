# 004 Overwrite a File

In the language of your choice, write code to overwrite the contents of an existing file.

**Task:**

- Create a script/program that:
  - Opens [004-overwrite.txt](/assets/004-overwrite.txt)
  - Overwrites its contents with the following lines:
    ```
    All work and no play
    makes Jack a dull boy.
    ```
  - Closes the file after writing.
  - Optionally, reads the file and prints its contents to the screen to verify the overwrite operation.

**Additional Requirements:**

- Ensure that your program handles the file using UTF-8 encoding to support Unicode characters.
- If the file does not exist, the program should create it.
