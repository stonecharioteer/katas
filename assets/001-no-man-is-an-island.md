# No Man Is an Island

> No man is an island,<br>
> Entire of itself,<br>
> Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
> A part of the main.<br>
> If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
> Europe is the less.<br>
> As well as if a promontory were.<br>
> As well as if a manor of thy friend's<br>
> Or of thine own were:<br>
> Any man's death diminishes me,<br>
> Because I am involved in mankind,<br>
> And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
> It tolls for thee.
